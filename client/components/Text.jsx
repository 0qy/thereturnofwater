        Within the Critique of Pure Reason, for instance, much of Kant’s intellectual labor is devoted to answering the question of how concepts which have no empirical content (viz., the categories of the understanding) can have any bearing at all upon objects of sensory experience.  He defines the pure understanding and the sensory materials of sensation as such widely divergent kinds of being, that he presents himself immediately with the difficult task of explaining how these two parts of the human mind can be related at all.
        In sum, we often find Kant drawing sharp and informative distinctions, and later having difficulty integrating the set of distinctions into a systematic whole.  The above-mentioned problem of explaining how understanding and sensibility are related is just one example.  Kant later encounters the problems of (1) how “reality” (things as they are in themselves) is related to “how this reality must appear to us,” and (2) how it is possible for a person to act freely within a natural world, if this world is completely determined by mechanical (and not obviously moral) laws.
